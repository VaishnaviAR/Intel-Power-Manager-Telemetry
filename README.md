# Intel-Power-Manager-Telemetry

Power manager telemetry refers to the collection, analysis, and reporting of data related to the power consumption and performance of electronic systems, particularly focusing on how different components within a system consume power over time. This telemetry data is crucial for understanding power usage patterns, identifying inefficiencies, and making informed decisions to optimize power consumption and improve overall energy efficiency.

## Problem Statement
Machine Learning Algorithms for Predictive Maintenance in Power Manager Telemetry Systems.

The primary objective of this project is to optimize the power consumption of a laptop system by analyzing and predicting power usage patterns using machine learning algorithms. This involves collecting power consumption data, identifying inefficiencies, and implementing solutions to enhance overall energy efficiency.
